The `Galv Frontend <https://galv-team.github.io/galv-frontend/>`_
is a web-based platform for battery data analysis and metadata management.
This documentation provides a guide to Galv's user-friendly web interface, known as the frontend.

Galv's frontend uses the `React <https://reactjs.org/>`_ framework and `Material-UI <https://material-ui.com/>`_
to provide a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface to the backend `REST API <https://galv-team.github.io/galv-backend/>`_.
